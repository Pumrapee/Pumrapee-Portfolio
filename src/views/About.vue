    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">I am a passionate and meticulous web developer with experience in backend development, API design, and frontend integration, using Java Spring Boot and Vue.js. My projects reflect a journey of growth and skill expansion, from designing efficient management systems to creating engaging interactive applications.</p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Starting with a Movie Management System, I developed a comprehensive system for cinemas, focusing on streamlined movie scheduling, ticketing, and customer service. This project taught me the fundamentals of database management, data integrity, and optimizing user experiences in high-traffic settings.</p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Next, in Camp Space, I contributed to a mobile app that allows campers to easily book campgrounds and connect with a community of fellow campers. I led feature planning and UX/UI design, creating an intuitive and engaging experience for both seasoned and new campers.</p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">In the Math Raining Game, I tackled game logic and performance optimization, developing a responsive equation-solving game with real-time interactions. Here, I implemented custom tutorials and strategic power-ups to keep users engaged, focusing on delivering smooth gameplay and effective performance management.</p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Most recently, with Kradan Kanban, I designed a Kanban board with team collaboration in mind, including role-based access and task management. This project honed my skills in secure authentication and RESTful API design, allowing me to deliver an efficient, user-centered task management tool.</p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree, Iâ€™m excited to bring these experiences into real-world projects, eager to keep exploring new technologies and backend solutions.</p>
